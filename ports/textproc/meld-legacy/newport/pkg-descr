Meld-legacy is a GNOME2 visual diff and merge tool from way back when.
Main difference is that it has fallback to save/read settings from users
home dir .config/meld/meldrc.ini if dbus is not available on the system.
The diff viewer lets you edit files in place (diffs update dynamically),
and a middle column shows detailed changes and allows merges.
The margins show location of changes for easy navigation, and it also
features a tabbed interface that allows you to open many diffs at once.
