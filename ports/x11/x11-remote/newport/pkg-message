To use ssh -X you need to add the following line to /etc/sshd_config:
  X11Forwarding yes
and restart sshd with "rcrestart sshd" or "service sshd restart".
Make sure /etc/hosts contains "127.0.0.1 HOSTNAME" as in hostname(1).

Some utilities might not function correctly without the RANDR extension
(Xlib:  extension "RANDR" missing on display "localhost:10.0".).
In that case, connect to the remote host using "ssh -Y user@remote" to
enable trusted X11 forwarding (use this only on trusted remote servers).
