Portsnap is a system for securely updating the FreeBSD ports tree by
distributing signed compressed snapshots over HTTP.  This is the
client half of that system; it downloads compressed snapshots into
/usr/local/portsnap ("portsnap fetch") and uses those to extract
a ports tree into /usr/ports ("portsnap extract") or update an
existing tree ("portsnap update").
