=============================================================================
The portsnap program will fetch the officially signed FreeBSD ports and place
them at /usr/ports.  These are useful to attempt to build ports not yet
imported into dports.

The default values of portsnap work fine in most cases, but it is possible to
alter parameters at %%PREFIX%%/etc/portsnap.conf
