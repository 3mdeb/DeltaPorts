# genpatch is similar to pkgsrc's pkgdiff
# 
# The main difference is that it will automatically generate a patch file
# with an appropriate name if it detects itself to be in the WRKDIR.
# Thus patches must be generated from ${WRKSRC} so the port can properly
# apply them.  Note that really only one argument is needed:
# 
# genpatch path/to/modified file.
#
# However, there must be a modified.orig or modified.intermediate file
# in the same location for that to work.  -- John Marino
