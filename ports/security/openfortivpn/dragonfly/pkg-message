NOTE: currently dns servers will be replaced in /etc/resolv.conf and not
restored once tunnel is destroyed, original entries will need to be added
manually if dhclient is default. The dhcpcd client works as expected.
Also you may need to create /dev/tunX interface first by running
"ifconfig tun2 create" or by adding cloned_interfaces in /etc/rc.conf.
Add the following to create /dev/tun0 automatically and use dhcpcd:

cloned_interfaces="tun0"
dhcp_client="dhcpcd"
EOM
