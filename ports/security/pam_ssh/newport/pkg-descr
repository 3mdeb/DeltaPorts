The SSH authentication component provides a function to verify the
identity of a user (pam_sm_authenticate()), by prompting the user for a
passphrase and verifying that it can decrypt the target user's SSH key
using that passphrase without user having direct access to private key.

NOTE: Ensure that users are using secure passphrases on remote systems!
