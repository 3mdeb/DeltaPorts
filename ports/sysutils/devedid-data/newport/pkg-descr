This port supplies linux generic EDID firmware blobs for use to override
monitor internal EDID one. Provided YYxYY.S files can be customized to
match specific monitor better. For information how to convert fw.bin to
usable kernel firmware module consult with firmware(9) and drm(4) or use
gen-fw_module.sh script to do it automagically.
